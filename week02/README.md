# Chapter 2: Data Types and Arithmetic Operators

Since programming is to manipulate data, and C/C++ handle data more efficiently at a lower level than many other languages such as Java, Python. To make the programs robust needs to understand different data types and their behaviors in arithmetic expressions.

## Integer numbers

* variables and their values
* overflow (be careful!)
* char and integer
* unicode(?)

## Floating point numbers

* binary format
* precision (32F and 64F), donâ€™t f1==f2

## Arithmetic Operators 

* + - * / %
* Data type conversions (explicitly, implicitly) 
* auto in C++11 and later
* ++, - - , +=, -=, *=, /=, 

## Lab

* test integer range
* conversion between char and integer
* test float number precision
